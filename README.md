# **Basic Calculator**

### **_Server Calculator_**
This project is a functionally working calulator that does calculations between two numbers and uses basic operators, namely Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division.
The = button will activate the function that does the calculation, given both input fields were filled and the operator was chosen, and it will display the result on the DOM as well as reveal a history of calculations below it. The C button will clear the input fields at user's will.
